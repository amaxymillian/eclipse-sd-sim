# Eclipse Second Dawn Battle Simulator
## (eclipse-sd-sim)


I created this project to have a way to settle often heated discussions with friends over the actual win probabilities of
the more complex engagements that can occur in the board game [Eclipse Second Dawn](https://en.lautapelit.fi/product/42986/eclipse---2nd-dawn-for-the-galaxy-from-us-stock).

Using a monte carlo approach this simulator can output the probabilities of each distinct outcome for any arbitrary combat situation that might occur in Eclipse Second Dawn.


##TODO:

* Finish core engine, including support for missiles and rift cannon damage

* Build web frontend for a drag and drop ship builder

* For fun, add Dask support to speed up the monte carlo simulation
